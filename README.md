## GIT-USER-APP

## Introduction

This is an app called Github Users that lets you search about Github users from all over the world
and view the different profiles of these users.
The main goal of this app is to let users get in touch with each other and have easier access to
each other's profiles. It aims to solve the inability of users to reach out to each other via
Github.

## Features

The key features of my application are the following;
- Search Functionality: Search for GitHub users by username or location.
- Internet Connectivity Handling: Detect and handle changes in internet connectivity, with prompts to guide users.
- Clean Architecture Implementation: Structured codebase for better maintainability and scalability.
