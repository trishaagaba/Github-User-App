## GIT-USER-APP

## Introduction

This is an app called Github Users that lets you search about Github users from all over the world
and view the different profiles of these users.
The main goal of this app is to let users get in touch with each other and have easier access to
each other's profiles. It aims to solve the inability of users to reach out to each other via
Github.

When the app is launched on the screen of the device, you are navigated to the Home Page after the
Splash screen has been displayed.
From there, a list of Github users is displayed from which you can scroll. To search for a specific
country, you can search using the 'Search Location' button,
while to search for a specific user, you can search using the 'Search Name' button. From thereon,
you can select a user's name to navigate to their profile page which displays
various information such as the country or number of public repositories. You can even choose to be
redirected to the user's profile or can even share the user's details.
